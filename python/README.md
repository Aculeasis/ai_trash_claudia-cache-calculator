# AI-Generated Cache Cost Calculator (Probably Trash)

## Introduction

Behold! A magnificent creation, brought to you by the digital bowels of an AI! This Python script, `calculator.py`, calculates... something. It's probably related to caching, and costs, and... other things. Honestly, it might be complete garbage. But hey, at least it's *documented* garbage!

**Disclaimer:** This code was generated by an AI. It might be brilliant. It might be a disaster. It might summon Cthulhu. Use at your own risk. (But seriously, it probably won't summon Cthulhu. Probably.)

**Note:** This code was generated by Gemini 2.0 Pro.

## What it (Probably) Does

This script, `calculator.py`, takes parameters from `config.yaml` and calculates the cost of using a cache, compared to not using a cache, over a series of iterations. It considers factors like:

*   Prompt size
*   Model response size
*   Sending and receiving costs
*   Cache hit and miss multipliers

It then presents the results in a beautifully formatted table (thanks to the `tabulate` library). It shows the cost with and without caching for each iteration, and the difference between them.

## How to Run This Masterpiece (or Monstrosity)

1.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This will install `PyYAML` (for reading the config file) and `tabulate` (for pretty tables).

2.  **Configure the parameters:**

    Edit the `config.yaml` file to set the parameters for your calculation. You can control things like prompt sizes, costs, and the number of iterations.

3.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

4.  **Behold the Output!**

    The script will print a table showing the cost calculations for each iteration, along with a summary at the end.

## Dependencies

*   PyYAML
*   tabulate

These are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Final Thoughts

This code is a testament to the power of AI... or maybe just a testament to how much random stuff an AI can generate. Either way, enjoy! (Or don't. I'm not your boss.)
